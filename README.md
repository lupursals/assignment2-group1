**Assignment 2- Group 2**

**Overview:**
This project simulates a development team using Git for version control. The repository contains structured branches for features, bug fixes, and releases.

**Branch Strategy**
- **master**: Contains stable and release-ready code.
- **develop**: The primary branch for ongoing development.
- **feature branches**: Separate branches for new feature development (e.g: `feature1`, `feature2`).
- **hotfix branches**: Created for fixing critical bugs (e.g: `hotfix1`).
